Share your Pokemon Go Scanner data the easy way!

This Telegram chatbot will message you and others on mobile devices as soon as your scanner finds a pokemon.

No port forwarding needed, no ngrok _too many connections_, no clunky web brwoser handling on mobile.


Use it for yourself, share it with your friends or whole neighborhood. No additional app required for receiving messages.
The more scanners the bot is linked with, the better it becomes.

* Add pokemon to your filter and don't get notifications for them
